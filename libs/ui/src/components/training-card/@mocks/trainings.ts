  notes:
    "Today's session involves high-intensity intervals to boost your pace. Run 10 mins. at an easy pace of 7:11 to 7:54 mins/km to get started. After this, run 2 minutes then walk another 2 mintues. Do this 6 times! These sessions are the ones which are going to make you faster! Speed sessions are tough mentally and physically but this is where you will make a lot of progress and the post run accomplishment feels great!. Finally run other 10 minutes at an easy pace",
